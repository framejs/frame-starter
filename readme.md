FrameJS Component library starter is a setup using [FractalJS](fractal.build/guide) for docmenting the components, while being a playground for development. 

TodoMVC is included for reference, showing how to write documentation and serves as an example on how to use [FrameJS](https://github.com/framejs/component).

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Start a development server:

```sh
$ npm start
```

Build for production and generate static documentation:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Enjoy!
